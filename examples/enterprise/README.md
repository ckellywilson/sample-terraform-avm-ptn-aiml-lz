# Enterprise AI/ML Landing Zone Example

This example demonstrates the enterprise deployment pattern for AI/ML landing zones using proper separation between platform and workload responsibilities. It showcases the recommended approach for organizations implementing AI/ML workloads at scale with centralized governance and distributed ownership.

## Architecture Overview

This deployment follows the Azure landing zone design pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
