# Sample configuration for creating a hub infrastructure using ALZ AVM
# Copy this to terraform.tfvars and customize for your environment
#
# IMPORTANT: This hub is typically deployed in a CONNECTIVITY SUBSCRIPTION
# The AI/ML Landing Zone will be deployed in a separate APPLICATION SUBSCRIPTION
# Ensure your authentication has permissions in both subscriptions for cross-subscription peering

# Basic Configuration
location       = "East US 2"
location_short = "eus2"

# Network Address Planning
# IMPORTANT: Ensure hub and AI/ML address spaces don't overlap
hub_address_space    = "10.0.0.0/16"     # Hub network (65,536 addresses)
ai_ml_address_space  = "192.168.0.0/22"  # AI/ML networks (1,024 addresses total)

# Azure Firewall Configuration
# Options: Basic (~$268/month), Standard (~$693/month), Premium (~$899/month)
firewall_sku = "Standard"

# DNS Configuration
# Leave empty to use Azure default DNS, or specify custom DNS servers
custom_dns_servers = []
# custom_dns_servers = ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]  # Example with custom DNS

# Private DNS Zones
# Set to true to create private DNS zones in the hub for centralized management
create_private_dns_zones = true

# Monitoring
# Set to true to create a Log Analytics workspace in the hub
create_log_analytics = false

# Resource Tags
tags = {
  Environment    = "hub"

# Example configurations for different environments:

# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
# Uncomment and modify for development scenarios:
# firewall_sku             = "Basic"           # Lower cost option
# create_log_analytics     = false            # Reduce costs
# hub_address_space        = "10.10.0.0/24"   # Smaller address space
# ai_ml_address_space      = "10.11.0.0/24"   # Adjacent address space

# PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT  
# Uncomment and modify for production scenarios:
# firewall_sku             = "Premium"        # Enhanced security features
# create_log_analytics     = true             # Enhanced monitoring
# custom_dns_servers       = ["10.0.1.4", "10.0.1.5"]  # Enterprise DNS servers
# hub_address_space        = "10.0.0.0/16"    # Large address space for growth
# ai_ml_address_space      = "192.168.0.0/20" # Larger space for multiple AI/ML LZs

# MULTI-REGION DEPLOYMENT
# Example for multi-region hub deployment:
# location                 = "West Europe"
# location_short           = "weu"  
# hub_address_space        = "10.1.0.0/16"    # Different region address space
# ai_ml_address_space      = "192.169.0.0/22" # Different region AI/ML space
