# Terraform Backend Configuration Summary

## Backend Storage Accounts Created

All storage accounts have been successfully created with Azure AD authentication enabled and storage key access disabled for enhanced security.

### Development Environment
- **Resource Group**: `terraform-state-rg-dev`
- **Storage Account**: `tfstatedev185492`
- **Container**: `tfstate`
- **State File Key**: `dev/aiml-lz.tfstate`
- **Location**: East US 2

### Staging Environment
- **Resource Group**: `terraform-state-rg-staging`
- **Storage Account**: `tfstatestaging185813`
- **Container**: `tfstate`
- **State File Key**: `staging/aiml-lz.tfstate`
- **Location**: East US 2

### Production Environment
- **Resource Group**: `terraform-state-rg-prod`
- **Storage Account**: `tfstateprod185873`
- **Container**: `tfstate`
- **State File Key**: `prod/aiml-lz.tfstate`
- **Location**: East US 2

## Authentication Configuration

### Service Principal Configuration
- **Authentication Method**: Service Principal with Azure AD
- **Required Roles**: Contributor + User Access Administrator
- **Credentials Storage**: Securely stored in `.env` file (not committed)
- **Scope**: Subscription-level access for resource management

### Roles Assigned
- **Contributor**: Full resource management permissions
- **User Access Administrator**: Ability to manage role assignments
- **Storage Blob Data Contributor**: Read/write access to storage containers (per storage account)

## Security Features

âœ… **Azure AD Authentication Only**: Storage key access disabled
âœ… **Least Privilege Access**: Service principal has minimal required permissions
âœ… **Encrypted at Rest**: All storage accounts use Microsoft-managed encryption
âœ… **HTTPS Only**: All traffic encrypted in transit
âœ… **No Public Blob Access**: Containers are private
âœ… **Cross-tenant Replication Disabled**: Enhanced security

## Usage Instructions

### Local Development (Service Principal)
```bash
# Set up authentication environment
source ./scripts/setup-local-auth.sh

# Navigate to desired environment
cd environments/dev  # or staging/prod

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan and apply
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### CI/CD Pipeline (Managed Identity)
In your CI/CD pipeline, the authentication will work automatically with managed identity:

```yaml
# Example for Azure DevOps
- task: AzureCLI@2
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'your-service-connection'
    scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
    inlineScript: |
      cd environments/dev
      terraform init
      terraform plan
      terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Terraform Backend Configuration

Each environment's `terraform.tf` file is configured with:

```hcl
backend "azurerm" {
  resource_group_name  = "terraform-state-rg-{environment}"
  storage_account_name = "tfstate{environment}{unique-suffix}"
  container_name       = "tfstate"
  key                  = "{environment}/aiml-lz.tfstate"
  use_azuread_auth     = true  # Critical for security
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure service principal credentials are set in environment variables
- Verify role assignments are propagated (may take up to 10 minutes)
- Check subscription context: `az account show`

### Permission Issues
- Service principal needs both Contributor and User Access Administrator roles
- Storage Blob Data Contributor role must be assigned per storage account
- Verify authentication mode: `az account show --query user.type`

### Backend Initialization Issues
- Ensure `use_azuread_auth = true` is set in backend configuration
- Verify storage account exists and is accessible
- Check container exists: `az storage container show --name tfstate --account-name {storage-account} --auth-mode login`

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Backend storage created and configured
2. âœ… Service principal authentication set up
3. âœ… All environments configured with secure backends
4. ðŸ”„ Ready to initialize and use Terraform in each environment
5. ðŸ”„ Set up CI/CD pipeline with managed identity authentication

The backend is now fully configured and follows security best practices by using Azure AD authentication instead of storage keys, making it production-ready and suitable for CI/CD pipelines.
